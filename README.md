# SciNet

SciNet, is a interactive web application leveraging statistical inference and Flask in Python to recommend scientific articles to a researcher. I developed this tool for every researcher who wants to expand his domain knowledge to adjacent fields beyond their current expertise.

This tool addresses the challenge of efficiently recommending peer-reviewed articles in response to the exponential growth of scientific literature. Annually, approximately 2.5 million scientific papers are published, highlighting the sheer volume of knowledge generated across various disciplines.

To put this into context, in 2013, there were an estimated 7.8 million full-time equivalent researchers globally. These researchers form a diverse community spanning academia, industry, and other research-focused sectors, driving innovation and advancement in their respective fields.

Facilitating the dissemination of research findings are approximately 28,000 active scholarly peer-reviewed journals. These journals serve as platforms for researchers to share their discoveries, insights, and methodologies with the broader scientific community, contributing to the collective body of knowledge.

The problem at hand was significant â€“ traditional recommendation systems often fail to consider the intricate nuances of topics within articles, resulting in less accurate recommendations. To overcome this limitation, I  utilized advanced NLP techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which hierarchically maps topics to articles and words to topics. This approach ensures a more nuanced understanding of article content, enhancing the precision of recommendations.

SciNet aims to address the needs of researchers, engineers, technicians, and conference organizers by providing a sophisticated article and jargon recommender system.

Citation-Network data is huge comprising of over 100K articles with over 0.5 Million edge connections. This is just the tip of the iceberg, a much larger data with over 64M publications since 1996 could boost the recommendation engiene's power in multiple domains.

Moreover, the integration of network characteristics and a jargon recommender further enriched the recommendation process. By leveraging network metrics such as centrality and depth, SciNet offers personalized recommendations based on citation networks, going beyond conventional factors like publication time and relevance. The jargon recommender complements these recommendations by suggesting similar keywords to facilitate exploration of unfamiliar topics, thereby improving the user experience.

The prototype of SciNet is an interactive web-based Flask application trained over a dataset comprising over 120,000 article abstracts. Its user-friendly interface enables researchers, engineers, and conference organizers to navigate the vast landscape of scientific literature effortlessly. Unlike conventional recommendation systems such as Google Scholar, SciNet offers a comprehensive solution that considers both the breadth and depth of scholarly articles.

The primary target audience includes researchers in academia, who rely on precise and relevant article recommendations to advance their knowledge and research. Engineers and technicians in industry also benefit from SciNet's capabilities, enabling them to access timely and tailored recommendations to support their work. Additionally, conference organizers can streamline the process of sorting and selecting references for presentations and publications using SciNet's advanced features.






SciNet addresses a critical need in academia and industry by providing a powerful tool for navigating scientific literature effectively. Through its advanced techniques and intuitive interface, SciNet empowers users to stay informed and make informed decisions, ultimately driving progress and discovery in the scientific community.
